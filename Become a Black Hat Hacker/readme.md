# **Become a Black Hat Hacker**
---
## You finally met the end of the labs, what now? Well you know enough about NodeMCUs and Kali Linux to make a stragetic plan to ruin a company. How will you do this? The plan is simple, you will get your team and break the work evenly.

## Your Target = Any local company
### Factors for considering a company (15 Minutes)
- Assets (Are there credentials, money?)
- Accessbility (Do you need any specific devices? Hard to stay anonymous?)
- Known Target (Is there enough information or knowledge about the company to perform a hack?)
- Punishment for failure (What happens if your hack goes wrong?)

## Great so you picked a company, now analysis (1 Hour & 45 Minutes)
- What type of damage are we doing? (stealing accounts, disabling services, etc)
  - How much would this cost the company? Does the attack have meaning?
- What are some countermeasures? (Should they hire a team? if not what devices should they use? if they get a team, how much would the investment be?)
  - What laws are being broken by the hack?  

*This is a general guideline but let this just be guidance for your presentation*

Presentation will have to be 2-5 Minutes
